## Getting Started

Within the [Makefile](Makefile) you can handle the entire flow to get everything up & running:

1. Install `make` on your computer, if you do not already have it.
2. Build the Docker image: `make build`
3. Start the application: `make up`

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5050/ping` to see that everything is up & running!
